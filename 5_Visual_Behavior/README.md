# Visual Behavior Dataset
This dataset contains 2-photon calcium imaging recordings from transgenically defined cell populations across two cortical regions while mice perform a visual change detection task. Each experiment includes the activity of individual neurons and behavioral data.

## Change Detection Task

The Visual Behavior project is built upon a change detection behavioral task.  Briefly, in this go/no-go task, mice are presented with a continuous series of flashed stimuli and they earn water rewards by correctly reporting when the identity of the flashed image changes (schematized below from Groblewski & Ollerenshaw, 2020).
