Synaptic Physiology Tutorial - CNS 2021
=======================================

This tutorial introduces the [Allen Institute Synaptic Physiology dataset](http://portal.brain-map.org/explore/connectivity/synaptic-physiology), which contains the results of simultaneous whole-cell recordings in human and mouse cortex.

We suggest three ways to run the code on your own:

* [Load the notebook in CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenInstitute/CNS_2021/blob/main/1_Synaptic_Physiology/SynPhys_Tutorial.ipynb) if you have a Google user account, and you are comfortable with allowing the notebook to run with access to your CoLab data (but note that this code does *not* access any of your pre-existing data, it just requires storage space to run).
* [Load the notebook in Mybinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AllenInstitute/aisynphys/cns-2021?filepath=doc/tutorial.ipynb). MyBinder is an awesome and free service that allows us to run customized Python/Jupyter environments on their severs. 
* Clone the [aisynphys repository](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/aisynphys/tree/cns-2021), check out the `cns-2021` branch, and install it in your own Python environment. Load up the [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/aisynphys/blob/cns-2021/doc/tutorial.ipynb) in Jupyter and follow along. [More instructions are available here](https://aisynphys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
