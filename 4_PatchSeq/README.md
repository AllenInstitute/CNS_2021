This tutorial introduces the Patch-seq data sets at the Allen Institute. You can find [information about these datasets on the Allen Institute site](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/classes/multimodal-characterization).
You can also browse the data using a new [Patch-seq web application](https://knowledge.brain-map.org/data/1HEYEW7GMUKWIQW37BO/specimens).

The code examples in the Jupyter notebook rely on several Allen Institute software packages:
- [Allen SDK](https://github.com/alleninstitute/allensdk)
- [IPFX](https://github.com/alleninstitute/ipfx)
- [neuron_morphology](https://github.com/alleninstitute/neuron_morphology)

Information about installing those packages is on their respective GitHub pages (or linked documentation pages).
